# 💰 Mutual Fund Plan with Python

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Mutual Fund Plan with Python** project helps investors create, analyze, and evaluate personalized mutual fund investment strategies.  
Using Python’s data analysis capabilities, this tool calculates key financial metrics, simulates performance scenarios, and visualizes the relationship between risk and returns.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a Python-based solution that:
- Collects and analyzes historical mutual fund data  
- Calculates risk and return metrics (Sharpe ratio, volatility, etc.)  
- Simulates portfolio outcomes under different investment scenarios  
- Recommends optimal allocations based on user risk preferences

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
- Source data using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage)
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values
- Compute derived features like annualized returns and expense ratios

### 2. **Portfolio Construction**
- Allow custom allocation of funds (e.g., 60% Fund A, 40% Fund B)
- Ensure diversification across multiple asset types

### 3. **Risk & Return Analysis**
- Calculate metrics:
  - **Annualized Return**
  - **Volatility (Standard Deviation)**
  - **Sharpe Ratio**
  - **Sortino Ratio**
- Run **Monte Carlo Simulations** to estimate future performance

### 4. **Visualization**
- **Line Charts:** Portfolio performance over time  
- **Pie Charts:** Fund allocation  
- **Risk-Return Scatter Plots:** Fund comparisons  
- **Heatmaps:** Performance trends over time  

### 5. **User Interaction**
- Users can input:
  - Investment amount  
  - Time horizon (e.g., 5–20 years)  
  - Risk tolerance (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- Tool suggests optimal portfolio allocations and expected outcomes
